# BayesianBiomechanics
Project on applying Bayesian learning to biomechanics
After spending some time learning about Bayesian and Probabilistic modeling, I created this repo as a way to show some exaples of 
how I have used this methodology in analyzing biomechanical results. There is no warranty on the code and it meant as a humble
learning and collaboration tool.
